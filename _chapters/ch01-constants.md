### Running your code

You can run any code sample fairly simply using the [__F#__ interactive tool `fsi`](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/fsharp/tools/fsharp-interactive/).

On your command line (assuming you have the [dotnet cli](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/languages/fsharp/tools) installed)
1. type `dotnet fsi`
2. copy and paste the code sample into the prompt that appears
3. and voila!

> TIP: the FSI uses double semi-colons (;;) to finish and execute code.  You may need to type _;;_ and _enter_ to execute the code sample.
